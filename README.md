# WELCOME
This open-source project is a great way to understand how to build a Chrome Extension (with Svelte).

It is a simple extension that shows a Pomodoro timer in a Chrome Side Panel, allows the user to run a timer, add tasks, and set their own
custom timers and colours.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Run `npm run build` to build the project
4. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
5. Enable Developer Mode
6. Click on `Load unpacked` and select this projects folder
7. The extension should now be loaded and ready to use
